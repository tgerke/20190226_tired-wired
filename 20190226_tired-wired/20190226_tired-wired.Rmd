# Tired/wired note-taking

* This thread walks through 15 hacks I noticed in the workshop
 + All consisted of some task that I've been doing "tired-style" for years
 + LET'S GET WIRED

# What `here:here()` solves

* Imagine I send you this script
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Desktop/projectRando/temp/")
dat <- read_delim("data/finalfinalv23.txt")
```
* Enjoy your afternoon refactoring (esp if you're on a Windows machine)!!!


* Instead, `here::here()` launches you into a local working directory via Rstudio projects`*`
 + Also writes paths in a OS safe manner
 + More complete argument https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/
 + Subtle advantage over `file.path()` that has to do with how `.Rmd` sets paths https://malco.io/2018/11/05/why-should-i-use-the-here-package/
 
.footnote[`*` Most often through `.Rproj`, though there are other ways e.g. `.here` files]

# 2: Use Alfred

# Alfred is Mac-specific (sorry Windows &#x1F3BB;)

* Alfred (https://www.alfredapp.com) is a productivity app
 + Through customizable hotkeys or keywords, you can customize how your Mac searches files or opens applications
 + Most useful for prioritizing `.Rproj` files on search (rather than 100s+ of other docs)
 + Here's Hadley Wickham describing his usage https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/968624630276804608

# 4: Load scripts with `callr`

# What `callr` solves

* When you source, `callr` (https://github.com/r-lib/callr) lets you perform computations in a separate R process without affecting the current R process
 + Consider the below example
